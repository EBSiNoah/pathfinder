PathFinder

I made pathfinder as common way. Start point from (0,0) which means left top of the graph.
In input string, 'R' makes go to x axis as +1, 'L' makes go to x axis -1, 'U' makes go to y axis -1, 'D' makes go to axis +1.
Repeat it until end of the input string.

I thought other 3 solution could make by first-order equation, recursion and non condition.
But I need more time.

I try non condition pathfinder. I thought the point is switch String to Vector. I get some hint from enum and struct.
Each directions are declared as Vector. Read the string and convert to charactor array. Every element also convert to custom enum or structure.
Here is the problem begin. The question is value can deal with as variable?
Maybe this way is absolutly worng, I should find out another way.

Think as we are making something new kind of data structure, not banish conditions.
We use 4 alphabet as express the direction. There are 26 alphabet in english.
It means index of size 26 array could be expressed as conditions.
After that, when input data over the range, I make some exception data structure as similar way.
